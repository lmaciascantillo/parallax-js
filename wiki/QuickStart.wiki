#summary API Documentation of parallax-js

= Prerequisites =

`parallax-js` is a jQuery plugin, so you need to include a current version of jQuery either. 
Additionally, you need images for your layers. It is recommended to use PNG, due to its alpha channel support. JPG is only useful for the farest layer (lowest z-Index).

= Quick Start =

To mount a parallax you need at least one layer. The more layers you use, the better the depth effect, but also comes with higher resource demands.
